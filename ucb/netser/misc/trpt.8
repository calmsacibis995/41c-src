.SH SYNOPSIS
.B trpt
[
.B \-s
]  [
.B \-p
hex-address ]
[ system [ core ] ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Trpt
interrogates the buffer of TCP trace records created
when a socket is marked for \*(lqdebugging\*(rq (see
.IR setsockopt (2)),
and prints a readable description of these records.
If the
.B \-s
option is given 
.I trpt
will print a detailed description of the packet
sequencing information at each point in the trace.
.If the
.B \-p
option is specified, along with the hexadecimal
address of a protocol control block (as shown by
the \-A option to
.IR netstat (1)),
then 
.I trpt 
will print only those trace records associated with
that session.
.PP
Any further arguments are interpreted as the system
image and/or core file.
.SH FILES
/vmunix, /dev/kmem
.SH "SEE ALSO"
setsockopt(2), netstat(1)
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
\(*lqno namelist\(*rq when the system image doesn't
contain the proper symbols to find the trace buffer;
others which should be self explanatory.
.SH BUGS
Should also print the data for each input or output,
but this is not saved in the race record.
