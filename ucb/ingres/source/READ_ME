.../source

The source code for the INGRES system lives in this directory.

RECOMPILATION

To recompile the system, use:

	cd conf; make allclean allinstall

This wil, clean out all objects from everywhere and then recompile
and install the entire system.  This can be expected to take about
1.5 hours.

RÏED MAP

conf
	Configuration files for the system.  This is the "main"
	directory -- the Makefile in this directory applies to
	the entire system, rather than just the particular module.
ctliod
	The control module.  This module provides interprocess
	communication and provides certain system functions.  It
	might be considered the "kernel" of the system.
dbu
	Database utilities.  These are things like print, help,
	copy, ksort, etc.
decomp
	Decomposition.  This module does query optimization.
equel
	The EQUEL preprocessor.
gutil
	General utilities.  These are not particular to INGRES,
	although they were written for INGRES.
h
	Header files.
iutil
	INGRES utilities.  This includes the old "access" library.
	This directory has the access methods and utility routines
	that are used throughout INGRES, but have no meaning outside
	of the INGRES context.
libq
	The EQUEL runtime support.
monitor
	The terminal monitor (front end).
ovqp
	One Variable Query Processor.  This is the "search engine"
	(basically a big interpreter).
parser
	The parser.  Takes text and produces query trees.
qrymod
	Query Modification.  This module supports views, integrity,
	and protection.
support
	All programs that are to be run from the shell are in this
	directory.
