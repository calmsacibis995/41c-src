This is a very new version of a multi-language debugger for UNIX.
Bugs are to be expected.

Interface files (.h) are automatically generated from implementation files (.c)
so they (the .h files) should not be modified.

Things to do:
    testing 1 2 3 ...
    dynamic scoping
    parameter passing
    tracing register variables
    dynamic bounds for ranges
    Fortran
    eliminate redundant header file information
    variable numbers of parameters
    overloading
    Pascal
    screen-oriented front end
    cleaner and more powerful event specification syntax
