06/28/82 - dmm (U. of Waterloo)
Added support for Vadic AD3451 autodialing modem, as well as merged
in a number of changes made at Waterloo over the past while.  The
following list may miss some.
anlwrk.c:	Fixed the order of the tests in the if in iswrk().
cico.c:		intrEXIT changed to reset whatever signal was
	caught rather than SIGEMT.  This is because abort() generates SIGILL
	rather than SIGEMT on the vax, causing infinite looping.
cntrl.c:	Changed to handle long login names if LONGNAMES is defined.
	Fixed sprintf(msg, ... to handle the fact that the W_MODE entry of
	wrkvec is not always used.
conn.c:		Vadic modem support added.  Changed to handle extensions
	to getargs().  Expect() now takes an argument specifying timeout
	period.  Sendthem doesn't scribble on the strings it is passed,
	and the semantics of backslash processing are changed a bit (I hope
	this doesn't break anyone's L.sys - the changes are minor).  Also,
	sendthem sends a CR rather than LF at end of string by default -
	unix doesn't care, but funny boxes that you may have to talk to
	probably prefer CR.  The expect strings now take '?' as a wildcard
	character.  Ifdate() handles times which cross midnight (well, sort of).
	2400 baud is now a supported speed.  Bugs fixed: login() closes
	the file descriptor if the login fails, expect() checks for
	overflow of rdvec before stuffing the null into it and resets the alarm
	before returning.  A few strings fixed up.
dial.c:		vadic() added.
getargs.c:	Now handles quoted strings to allow embedded blanks;
	supports ^X syntax for entering control characters.
getprm.c:	Fixed to look for '&' and '`' in command lines properly.
pk1.c:		GETRIES (maximum retries) changed from 5 to 10 - helps
	prevent losing connection when other end is just sluggish.
prefix.c:	added wprefix - prefix match with wildcard.
uucp.c:		Changed to support LONGNAMES; two additional
		calls to expfile() added to expand '~' in type 3
		and 4 transfers.
uucp.h:		Added support for -n and -z flags of uux; added LONGNAMES.
uux.c:		Added support for -n and -z flags, and LONGNAMES.
uuname.c:	Changed to handle longer L.sys entries.
uuxqt.c:	Added fclose(xfp) near bottom of main() to prevent uuxqt
	dying after processing 15 X. files (it ran out of file descriptors.)
	Support for -n and -z flags added.  notify() changed to limit the
	length of the string it sends back; it used to die on long command
	strings.
makefile:	In the dependency list for "install", put "cp" after "cpfiles".
	This is because "cpfiles" does a chown on INSDIR/*, clobbering
	all the setuid bits carefully set up by "cp" if you're running
	Berkeley unix with paranoia turned on.  Also commented out
	the copy of USERFILE into INSDIR.

06/02/82 - ctc
uuxqt.c:	Changed the size of the prm arraye from MAXCHARLINE
to BUFSIZ.  This keeps it from dumping core on large usenet addresses.

05/10/82 - ctc
uux.c and Makefile: Added a call to logcls in the routine cleanup().
This fix from Bill Shannon at DEC to get rid of the old log files
that tend to hang around forever.

04/22/82 - ctc
uucp.h, uucpname.c: Added support for the new UCB 4.1A and later
system's gethostname system call.  Added a new macro to define
this option: GETHOST

03/03/82 - ctc
uuxqt.c:	Fixed a security hole allowing aribitray users to
steal any protected file.  One line change.  Not allowing subshells
to preform the Apersand or Backquote operations from uuxqt.c
See about line 140.

02/26/82 - ctc
uucp.h:		Changed the MAXCHARTIME constant from 100 seconds
to 7 seconds.  This allows us to login on epsvax before it time
outs.

02/24/82 - ctc
makefile:	Fixed to do the chown's and chmod's in the right order

conn.c:	Added support for the develcon portselector and added the fix
	to use the UCB break ioctl instead of the NULL's kludge.
	An example L.sys entry is:
ucbtest Any ACU 1200 2%%7773%% quest:-r\ds\c-quest:-r\ds\c tek in:-\b-in:-EOT-in:-\b-in:-EOT-in:-\b-in: tstuucp assword: uucp

02/09/82 - ctc
cntrl.c:   Added Steve McGeady's fix for long uucp directory searches,
	the one the corrected a core dump!
uuxqt.c:   Added finger(1) to the list of allowable commands and
exported the PATH variable so fix a security hole.  Ala the UUCP net.

/* UCB installed the YALE Changes directly */
02/08/82 - ctc
/* Yale changes */
11/8/81 --asp
anlwrk.c: Changed LLEN to 100 from 20, and changed line 65 definition of
	list[LLEN] to lint[LLEN+1] to handle list overflows.

10/6/81  (cico.c)       Import IS/1 code for ventel support
   dial.c is new code that deals with the ventel.  conn.c has a
   table so that L-devices says ACUVENTEL (but L.sys says ACU).
   The ventel senses speed by looking for two carriage returns a
   10th of a second apart; there's some crock code to send them.
   The switch settings for the ventel are: (looking at it from the
   rear)
	UDUDDDDUUU UUDUDDDDUD

   The IS/1 stuff can handle using a single terminal line for dialin and
   dialout; routines 'enable' and 'disable' do this.  They also have
   programs that explicitly reenable the line; also have changed
   around utmp so that stuff that was in /etc/ttys is now in utmp.
   All this stuff is currently disabled; the ventel is for dialout only.
